## London Hackathon
The aim of the challenge was to recreate a better way for bars and brands to do buisess. 

__EZtenda__ is a platform hosting and online auction, where bars can tender their listing deals and drinks while brands can bid for them.

_“Listing deals between bars and drinks brands are essential.  Bars use them to unlock revenue while drinks brands use them to secure product distribution. These deals are done in person, which is a slow, inefficient process that’s shrouded in secrecy. But now there is an online auction where bars can openly tender their listings deals and drinks brands can bid for them – a bit like Ebay. This easy and intuitive platform is Eztenda.”_
